# Introduction
This is a simple personal project for exposing public data on COVID-19 cases in
the city and county of San Francisco. Feel free to submit a pull request to
update the data and/or improve the code.

You can find the source data in [san-francisco.csv](san-francisco.csv).

# Local development
You must serve the csv files for your development environment, i.e. by running
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 &` and then accessing http://localhost:8888/
in your browser.
